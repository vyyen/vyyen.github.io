			<p>On April 10, 2012, a photo of Jennie was uploaded with the question, "Who's that girl?" via the official blog of YG Entertainment.[16] Her name was not revealed at the time, so she was called "Mystery Girl" and rumoured to be a potential of YG's upcoming girl group. Her photograph gained a great deal of interest from netizens for her mysterious charm and unique exotic beauty. She instantly became the most searched-after topic on numerous portal sites under the name "Mystery Girl".Information about her identity eventually was discovered through netizens' investigations. On April 13, a YG Entertainment representative verified the information and were unable to hide their surprise by stating, "The name and age are right. When she was very young, she moved abroad so we didn't believe individuals in Korea would uncover her profile with just a photo".</p>
		    <h2 id="now">2017–present: Television success and solo debut</h2>
		    <p>Jennie appeared with fellow Blackpink member Jisoo on Running Man in July 2018. A video of her crying after going through a horror room with Lee Kwang-soo went viral in South Korea, gaining over one million views on a portal site, and a total of over three million views when counting total views on major portal sites, VOD, and social media. She was selected as the best variety star of 2018 discovered by Running Man. Jennie was immediately invited again after dominating searched keywords in real time and attracting big view ratings through her previous appearance.</p>

		    <h2 id="style">Fashion and voice</h2>
		    <p>For her solo debut, she was very involved in the production of the outfits, concept, and choreography. Jennie put together more than 20 outfits, for her music video. She recalled in an interview with Billboard that during the process she had thought about the way each outfit would accompany the song and what she could do differently, helping her to learn many different ways of approaching fashion. Vocal coach Shin Yoo-Mi, who's worked with Blackpink for six years until they debuted, had trained Jennie during preparations for her solo debut. In an interview, she described Jennie as a multi-player who is good at singing, rapping, and writing lyrics.</p>
